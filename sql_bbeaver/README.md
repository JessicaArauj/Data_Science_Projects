# SQL database queries using BBeaver

This repository contains **SQL scripts** for studying and practicing database queries using **BBeaver**. The scripts cover **data selection, filtering, projection, joins, table creation, insertion, updates and deletion**.

## Overview

### Data selection and filtering
- Retrieve all records from a table.
- Limit query results with `LIMIT`.
- Count rows with `COUNT()`.
- Filter rows using `WHERE` with operators such as `=`, `>=`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, and logical operators `AND`, `OR`.
- Handle `NULL` and non-`NULL` values.

### Projection and aliases
- Select specific columns.
- Rename columns using `AS` for clarity.

### Data manipulation
- Insert new records into tables with `INSERT INTO`.
- Update existing records with `UPDATE`.
- Delete records with `DELETE`.

### Joins
- Combine data from multiple tables using `INNER JOIN`.
- Understand the difference between proper joins and Cartesian products.

### Table management
- Create tables with `CREATE TABLE`.
- Drop tables with `DROP TABLE`.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JessicaArauj/Data_Science_Projects
```

2. Navigate to the project folder of interest:

```bash
cd sql_bbeaver
```

3. Open the jupyter notebook or python scripts and run the code step by step.

4. Generated visualizations will be saved as PNG files, and the PDF report will be created automatically.

## Notes

- The scripts are designed for learning and experimentation.
- Some queries may require sample datasets or a configured database.
- SQL syntax may vary slightly depending on the database (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.).
