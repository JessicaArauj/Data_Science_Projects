# Non-parametric statistics

This repository contains multiple projects in **non-parametric statistics**, demonstrating **hypothesis testing, data analysis and visualization without parametric assumptions**. Each project is self-contained and includes code, sample datasets and detailed documentation.

## Overview

### McNemar test

- Focus: **Perform the McNemar test for paired nominal data**.
- Highlights:
  - Implements the **McNemar test** in R.
  - Performs **data preprocessing, contingency tables and result interpretation**.
  - File: `test_mcnemar.Rmd`
  - Tools: **R** and **RStudio**

### Binomial test

- Focus: **Perform binomial tests on categorical data**.
- Highlights:
  - Applies the **binomial test** to assess success probabilities.
  - Generates **summary tables and visualizations**.
  - File: `test_binomial.Rmd`
  - Tools: **R** and **RStudio**

### Kolmogorov-smirnov test

- Focus: **Test for distribution differences using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test**.
- Highlights:
  - Compares empirical distributions.
  - File: `test_kolmogorov.Rmd`
  - Tools: **R** and **RStudio**

### Chi-square test

- Focus: **Analyze relationships between categorical variables**.
- Highlights:
  - Implements the **chi-square test** for independence.
  - File: `test_qui_quadrado.Rmd`
  - Tools: **R** and **RStudio**

### Wilcoxon test

- Focus: **Perform the Wilcoxon signed-rank and rank-sum tests**.
- Highlights:
  - Applies **paired and unpaired non-parametric tests**.
  - File: `test_wil.Rmd`
  - Tools: **R** and **RStudio**

## How to use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JessicaArauj/Data_Science_Projects
```

2. Navigate to the project folder of interest:

```bash
cd non_parametric_statistics
```

3. Open the R script or R Markdown file and run the code step by step in RStudio or another R environment.

## Notes

- Projects are designed for learning, experimentation, and reporting purposes.  
- Large datasets may require sufficient memory and computation resources.  
- Code is written in **R** and executed using **RStudio**, utilizing standard data analysis and statistical libraries.
