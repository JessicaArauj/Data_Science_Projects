# Exploratory Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains multiple projects in **data analysis and visualization**, demonstrating **participant profiling, revenue impact, employability and program evaluation**. Each project is self-contained and includes code, generated visualizations and a detailed PDF report.

## Overview

### Participant profiling

- Focus: **Analysis of participants' demographics and business profiles**.
- Highlights:
  - Evaluates **education level, diversity, gender, income, market niche, and competitiveness**.
  - Generates **bar charts and pie charts** to visualize distributions.
  - Tools: **python**, **pandas**, **matplotlib**, **numpy**, and **reportlab**.

### Employability analysis

- Focus: **Assessment of job creation after the program**.
- Highlights:
  - Calculates **percentage of participants who created new jobs**.
  - Visualizes employability impact using **bar charts**.
  - Tools: **python**, **pandas**, **matplotlib**.

### Revenue impact analysis

- Focus: **Evaluation of revenue increase or decrease after program participation**.
- Highlights:
  - Calculates **percentage change in revenue** for each participant.
  - Identifies participants with **more than 50% increase**.
  - Generates **bar charts** showing revenue growth by class.
  - Tools: **python**, **pandas**, **matplotlib**.

### Program importance analysis

- Focus: **Perceived impact and importance of the program**.
- Highlights:
  - Aggregates participantsâ€™ ratings across multiple categories.
  - Generates **pie charts** summarizing overall positive impact.
  - Tools: **python**, **pandas**, **matplotlib**.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
